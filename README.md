## Game Instructions

Initially (when the game starts), the scores for both the player and the computer are 0.

The player can then click either of the buttons at the bottom row to select rock or paper or scissor (as shown in the image above).

Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper and paper covers rocks.

Here is how the scoring works:

If the computer chooses Rock and the player chooses Scissors, the computer wins and scores 1 point.

If the computer chooses Scissors and the player chooses Paper, the computer wins and scores 1 point.

If the computer chooses Paper and the player chooses Rock, the computer wins and scores 1 point.

## conversely

If the player chooses Rock and the computer chooses Scissors, the player wins and scores 1 point.

If the player chooses Scissors and the computer chooses Paper, the player wins and scores 1 point.

If the player chooses Paper and the computer chooses Rock, the player wins and scores 1 point.

If they both choose the same thing, for example player choses rock and the computer choses rock or player choses paper and the computer choses paper, then it's a draw and they both score 0.
